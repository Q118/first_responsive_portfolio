# First Responsive Portfolio

## Description 

* This is ur unit two homework assignment in UCSD extensions Bootcamp; building a responsive portfolio with CSS and Bootstrap
* I decided to add a "Marvel" theme to the site for fun and practice. 
* The intention with this assignment was to build upon our lessons of html, CSS layout, and Bootstrap to create a site with responsive design that ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
* It is great practice because in the future, as a developer, I will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.
* Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework, components, and grid system; I created a mobile responsive portfolio about my favorite Marvel characters
